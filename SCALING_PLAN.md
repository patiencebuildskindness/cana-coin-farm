# CANA Coin Farm - Path to 7000+ Plants & Multiplayer Economy

## Current Status
- 369 medicinal plants ready
- Basic game mechanics working
- Need: proper database, multiplayer, PoG system

## Priority Order:
1. Fix current game with proper database structure
2. Add multiplayer marketplace (like FarmTown)
3. Implement Proof of Growth with photo verification
4. Scale to 7000+ plants with regional databases

This scales to millions of users and billions of transactions.
